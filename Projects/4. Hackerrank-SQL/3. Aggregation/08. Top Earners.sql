/* The EMPLOYEE table is described as follows: 

		+-------------+----------+
		| Field       | Type     |

		| employee_id | Integer  |
		| name        | String   |

    We define an employee's total earnings to be their monthly  worked, 
	and the maximum total earnings to be the maximum total earnings for any employee in the Employee table. 
    
    Write a query to find the maximum total earnings for all employees as well as the total number of employees who have maximum total earnings. 
    Then print these values as  space-separated integers. */
