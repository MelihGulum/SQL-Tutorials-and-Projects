    You did such a great job helping Julia with her last coding contest challenge that she wants you to work on this one, too!

    The total score of a hacker is the sum of their maximum scores for all of the challenges. 
    Write a query to print the hacker_id, name, and total score of the hackers ordered by the descending score. 
    If more than one hacker achieved the same total score, then sort the result by ascending hacker_id. 
    Exclude all hackers with a total score of 0 from your result. */
