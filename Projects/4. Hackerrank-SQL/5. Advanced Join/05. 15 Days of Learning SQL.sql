    Julia conducted a 15 days of learning SQL contest. The start date of the contest was March 01, 2016 and the end date was March 15, 2016.

    Write a query to print total number of unique hackers who made at least 1 submission each day (starting on the first day of the contest), 
        and find the hacker_id and name of the hacker who made maximum number of submissions each day. 
    If more than one such hacker has a maximum number of submissions, print the lowest hacker_id. 
    The query should print this information for each day of the contest, sorted by the date. */
